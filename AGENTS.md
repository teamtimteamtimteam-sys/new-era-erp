# Database mirrors

`db/tables/`, `db/functions/`, `db/views/` mirror the live schema so it can be rebuilt from the repo. **Any migration that touches a table must update that table's mirror file in the same commit** — same for functions and views. Single-function files under `db/functions/` are exact `pg_get_functiondef` bytes; table mirrors are first-run CREATE scripts with columns in live ordinal order (ALTER-added columns stay at the end).

When in doubt run `python3 db/check_mirrors.py` — it replays the whole mirror set into a scratch schema inside a rolled-back transaction and diffs the catalogs against live (exit 0 = clean). Never paste a table mirror into the live DB directly: table mirrors contain `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` and would silently overwrite live functions — the script's header explains both hazards.
