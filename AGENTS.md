# Database mirrors

`db/tables/`, `db/functions/`, `db/views/` mirror the live schema so it can be rebuilt from the repo. **Any migration that touches a table must update that table's mirror file in the same commit** — same for functions and views. Single-function files under `db/functions/` are exact `pg_get_functiondef` bytes; table mirrors are first-run CREATE scripts with columns in live ordinal order (ALTER-added columns stay at the end).

When in doubt run `python3 db/check_mirrors.py` — it replays the whole mirror set into a scratch schema inside a rolled-back transaction and diffs the catalogs against live (exit 0 = clean). Never paste a table mirror into the live DB directly: table mirrors contain `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` and would silently overwrite live functions — the script's header explains both hazards.

## RUNTIME CONFIG bootstraps: what the harness cannot see

`check_mirrors.py` classifies seeded tables two ways (see `SEED_TABLES` /
`RUNTIME_CONFIG_TABLES`). RUNTIME CONFIG tables — the ones an operator can change
through the app — are **deliberately not row-compared against live**, because live
diverging from the file is the system working correctly, not drift.

That exemption is drawn in the right place, but it has an edge. The harness does
still **replay** each bootstrap into a scratch schema, so it already catches:

* a seeded column that was renamed or dropped (replay fails — proven against the
  `days_per_month` → `days_per_year` change);
* a seeded value that violates the table's own constraints (replay fails);
* a `NOT NULL` column added since, with no default, that the seed omits (replay fails);
* a bootstrap that seeds **zero** rows overall (`bootstrap` line, fails);
* a bootstrap referencing a permission code, role code or account code that its own
  mirror set does not define (`integrity` line, fails).

**What it cannot see, and you must check by reading:**

> **When a migration changes the MEANING of a column that a RUNTIME CONFIG table
> seeds, without changing its name or type, nothing will tell you the bootstrap is
> now wrong.** Re-read every affected bootstrap in the same commit.

The case that prompted this rule: HR-2c changed `leave_accrual_rates` from a monthly
figure to an annual one. It happened to rename the column, so a stale bootstrap would
have failed the replay — but had the column kept its name, the file would still have
said `2.0` and `1.5`, a rebuilt production database would have given every office
employee **2 days of annual leave a year instead of 24**, and `check_mirrors` would
have reported a clean bill of health.

So: **a migration that touches a RUNTIME CONFIG table must state, in the same commit,
whether its bootstrap default is still correct.** Not "still valid" — the harness
answers that. Still *correct*, meaning the numbers in it still mean what they meant.
